# Artifact package for the CAT paper

We provide two ways to run the experiment: pre-configured environment in a VirtualBox image and guidance on running the experiment on your local environment.

## Option 1. Running in the virtual machine (recommended)

Virtual VM download links: 

- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14K7R1qwWSTJDzpj1NwRj1rMQGjwQ1a0T/view?usp=sharing)
- [iCloud Drive](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0ia_t8cbPd7zFY5PBosCnDY3Q#CAT)

The provided image can be run on VirtualBox 6.1.6 onwards as this version starts supporting nested virtualisation for running Android Emulator on both Intel and AMD CPUs.

### Prerequisites

- VirtualBox 6.1.6 onwards. Download from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Ensure your CPU supports nested virtualisation.
- Download the *ova* file from this repository.

### Running CAT

I) VirtualBox Image Setup
   1. Install and open VirtualBox.
   2. Click **Tools** and then **Import** the downloaded *ova* file.
   3. Start the imported virtual machine and input the user credentials: username=cat and password=catdroid


II) Run Experiments
   1. Open **Terminal** from the side bar.
   2. Start the emulator by typing the following command:

```
emulator -avd Nexus_5_API_22
```
   3. Open another **Terminal** and go to the CAT folder:

```
cd CAT/dataset
ls
```
   4. Select one of the interested subject app folder and go into the folder
   5. Run the following command to test the app with CAT:

```
catdroid -a API_FILE_NAME -script script.json -o OUTPUT_FOLDER
```

### Interpreting the result

   - Target states: during the execution, once the target state is entered, a message showing target state with index is shown.
   - Target events: All event sequences are stored in the OUTPUT_FOLDER/events. File names ending with *_KEY_EVENT.json* are those target events.

## Option 2. Running on your local environment

### Prerequisites

1. [Java 8 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
2. [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio). These components needs to be installed in the SDK manager: An Android SDK Platform, Android SDK Command-line Tools, Android Emulator, Android SDK Platform-Tools and HAXM Accelerator.
3. Python3 with Pip3

### Installing CAT

Clone this repo, enter the *cat-droidbot* folder and run

```
pip3 install -e .
```

### Running CAT and interpreting the result

This is same as Option 1. [Running CAT](#running-cat) and [Interpret the Result](#interpret-the-result)
